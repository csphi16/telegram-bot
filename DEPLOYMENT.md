```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000
```

### 2.2 Frontend Environment Variables

The frontend is served directly by the backend as a static SPA, so no separate frontend deployment is needed. All requests to `/api/...` are handled by the backend, and the React app is served from the same URL.

---

## 3. GitHub Actions Secrets Setup

The GitHub Actions deployment workflow (`deploy.yml`) deploys to Railway automatically on every push to `main`. It requires a Railway project token configured as a GitHub secret.

### 3.1 Generate a Railway Project Token

A **project token** is a scoped token that grants access only to a specific Railway project and environment. This is the recommended token type for CI/CD.

1. Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Open your project
3. Go to **Project Settings** → **Tokens**
4. Click **"New Token"**
5. Give it a name (e.g., `github-actions`) and select the **production** environment
6. Copy the generated token

### 3.2 Add the Secrets as GitHub Secrets

The workflow uses the `production` environment in GitHub Actions. You can add secrets either at the repository level or the environment level:

**Option A – Repository environment secrets (recommended):**

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Environments**
2. Click on **"production"** (create it if it doesn't exist)
3. Under **"Environment secrets"**, click **"Add secret"**
4. Add each required secret (see table below)
5. Click **"Add secret"**

**Option B – Repository-level secrets:**

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add each required secret (see table below)

**Required secrets:**

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway project token (see [step 3.1](#31-generate-a-railway-project-token)) |
| `RAILWAY_SERVICE` | Exact name of the Railway service to deploy (e.g. `backend`) |

> **Note:** If either `RAILWAY_TOKEN` or `RAILWAY_SERVICE` is missing or empty, the deployment step will be skipped with a warning message pointing to this guide. To find your service name, open your Railway project dashboard and note the name shown on the service card.

---

## 4. Database Migration

### Automatic Migrations

Database migrations run **automatically** on each deployment via the pre-deploy command in `railway.toml`:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This runs as a `preDeployCommand` — Railway executes the migration in a one-off container *before* promoting the new deployment live. If the migration fails, the deployment is rolled back and the previous version keeps serving traffic. This prevents broken schema from reaching the running app.

### Manual Migration (if needed)

If you need to run migrations manually:

1. Install the Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Link to your project:
   ```bash
   railway link
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Verify Migrations

To check the current migration status:

```bash
railway run alembic current
```

To see migration history:

```bash
railway run alembic history
```

---

## 5. Webhook Configuration

After deployment, you need to configure webhooks for external services.

### 5.1 Get Your Backend URL

1. Go to your Railway backend service
2. Click on the **"Settings"** tab
3. Find the **"Public Networking"** section
4. Copy your **Railway domain** (e.g., `https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app`)

### 5.2 Xendit Webhook Setup

1. Log in to your [Xendit Dashboard](https://dashboard.xendit.co)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Add a new webhook URL:
   ```
   https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/xendit/webhook
   ```
4. Select the events you want to receive:
   - `payment.succeeded`
   - `payment.failed`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.expired`
5. Save the webhook configuration

### 5.3 PayMongo Webhook Setup

1. Log in to [PayMongo Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymongo.com) → **Developers → Webhooks**
2. Create a webhook pointing to:
   ```
   https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/paymongo/webhook
   ```
3. Enable events: `source.chargeable`, `checkout_session.payment.paid`, `checkout_session.payment.failed`, `payment.paid`, `payment.failed`
4. Copy the **signing secret** → set as `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5.4 TransFi Webhook Setup

1. Log in to your [TransFi Checkout dashboard](https://checkout-dashboard.transfi.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integration** (or **Webhooks**)
3. Add a new webhook URL:
   ```
   https://<your-railway-domain>/api/v1/transfi/webhook
   ```
4. Copy the **webhook secret** and set it as `TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment variables.
5. Save the webhook configuration.

### 5.5 Telegram Webhook Setup

The Telegram webhook is automatically registered on startup when `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` is set. To set it up manually:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook"
  }'
```

Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token and update the URL with your Railway backend domain.

To verify the webhook is set:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
```

## 6. Post-Deployment Steps

### 6.1 Verify Backend is Running

Check the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### 6.2 Verify Frontend is Running

Open your Railway backend URL in a browser:
```
https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app
```

### 6.3 Check Database Connection

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on the backend service
3. Click on **"Deployments"** tab

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Invalid or Missing RAILWAY_TOKEN

**Error**: `Invalid RAILWAY_TOKEN. Please check that it is valid and has access to the resource you're trying to use.`

**Solution**:
1. Generate a Railway project token: **Project Settings** → **Tokens** → **New Token** (select the **production** environment)
2. Add it as a GitHub secret named `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (see [GitHub Actions Secrets Setup](#3-github-actions-secrets-setup) for detailed instructions)
3. Verify the secret is added to the correct scope: the deploy workflow uses the `production` environment, so the secret should be an **environment secret** under the `production` environment, or a **repository secret**
4. If the token was previously set but is now expired or revoked, generate a new token and update the secret

#### Multiple Services Found / Missing RAILWAY_SERVICE

**Error**: `Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the --service flag.`

**Solution**:
1. Find your Railway service name by opening your Railway project dashboard and noting the name on the service card (e.g. `backend`)
2. Add it as a GitHub secret named `RAILWAY_SERVICE` (see [GitHub Actions Secrets Setup](#3-github-actions-secrets-setup))
3. If `RAILWAY_SERVICE` is missing or empty, the deploy step will be skipped with a warning rather than failing the workflow

#### Database Connection Errors

**Error**: `Failed to initialize database`

**Solution**:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in environment variables
2. Check PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
3. Ensure the database URL format is: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

#### Migration Failures

**Error**: `alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Can't locate revision identified by`

**Solution**:
1. Check if migrations are in sync:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic current
   ```
2. If needed, reset to head:
   ```bash
   railway run alembic stamp head
   railway run alembic upgrade head
   ```

#### CORS Errors

**Error**: `Access to fetch at 'https://backend...' from origin 'https://frontend...' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Solution**:
1. Add your frontend URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```

#### Port Binding Issues

**Error**: `Address already in use`

**Solution**:
Railway automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. Ensure your application uses `$PORT`:
```python
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

#### Telegram Webhook Not Receiving Updates

**Solution**:
1. Verify webhook is set correctly:
   ```bash
   curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo"
   ```
2. Check if the URL is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook
   ```
3. Delete and reset the webhook:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/deleteWebhook"
   curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" -d "url=https://paybot-backend-production-84b2.up.railway.app/api/v1/telegram/webhook"
   ```

#### Admin Login Issues

**Error**: `Telegram admin authentication is not configured` (500 error on login)

**Solution**:
1. Set `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable
2. Set `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` to your Telegram numeric user ID (find it via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
3. Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to a secure random string

## AWS Deployment (ECS Fargate)

This guide provisions PayBot on AWS using **ECS Fargate** (containerised, serverless compute) with **RDS PostgreSQL** behind an **Application Load Balancer**.

### ⚡ One-click deployment

The fastest path is the `aws/setup.sh` script.  It handles every step below — CloudFormation, IAM, Docker build, ECR push, ECS service creation, and Telegram webhook registration — in a single command:

**Prerequisites:** [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with `aws configure`), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

```bash
./aws/setup.sh \
  --telegram-token   "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" \
  --telegram-username "your_bot_username" \
  --telegram-admin-ids "123456789" \
  --xendit-key       "xnd_production_..." \
  --github-repo      "PayBot-PH/paybot"   # optional — auto-sets CI/CD secrets via gh CLI
```

All other flags are optional — `--db-password`, `--jwt-secret`, and `--admin-password` are auto-generated and saved to `.env.aws`.  Run `./aws/setup.sh --help` for the full flag reference.

> ⏱ First run takes ~15 minutes (CloudFormation waits for RDS to provision). Subsequent runs are faster.

---

### Manual step-by-step guide

Follow the steps below if you prefer full control, are debugging a failed script run, or need to integrate with an existing AWS account.

### Architecture overview

```
Internet → ALB (port 80 / 443)
             └─► ECS Fargate task (port 8000, public subnet)
                   └─► RDS PostgreSQL (private subnet)
```

All resources live in a dedicated VPC.  ECS tasks are placed in public subnets with public IPs so they can reach ECR, Telegram, Xendit, and PayMongo without a NAT Gateway (which saves cost).  RDS is placed in private subnets and is only reachable from within the VPC.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with permissions to create CloudFormation stacks, IAM roles, ECS, RDS, ECR, and ALB resources
- AWS CLI installed locally (`aws --version`)
- Docker installed locally (for the first manual image push, optional)
- GitHub repository access to add Secrets and Variables

### Step 1 — Deploy the CloudFormation infrastructure stack

The `aws/cloudformation.yml` template creates everything except the ECS service (which is managed by the GitHub Actions deploy workflow).

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name paybot \
  --template-file aws/cloudformation.yml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides \
      EnvironmentName=paybot \
      DBPassword=<strong-random-password> \
      DBInstanceClass=db.t3.micro \
      CertificateArn=<your-acm-arn-or-leave-empty>
```

> ⏱ The stack takes 10–15 minutes to provision (RDS is the slowest resource).

After the stack is created, note the outputs — you will need them for GitHub secrets:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name paybot \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
  --output table
```

Key outputs:
| Output key | How it is used |
|---|---|
| `LoadBalancerDNS` | Your app's public URL; also set as `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` |
| `DBEndpoint` | RDS hostname; used to build `DATABASE_URL` |
| `ECRRepositoryURI` | Push your Docker image here |

### Step 2 — Create an IAM user for GitHub Actions

Create a least-privilege IAM user that GitHub Actions will use to deploy:

```bash
# Create the user
aws iam create-user --user-name paybot-github-actions

# Attach a policy granting ECR push + ECS deploy + CloudFormation read access
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name paybot-github-actions \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser

aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name paybot-github-actions \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonECS_FullAccess

aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name paybot-github-actions \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudFormationReadOnlyAccess

# Generate access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name paybot-github-actions
```

Save the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` — you will add them as GitHub Secrets below.

### Step 3 — Configure GitHub repository secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** in your GitHub repository and add:

#### Required secrets

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | IAM access key ID (from Step 2) |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM secret access key (from Step 2) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Same password passed to CloudFormation in Step 1 |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` | Bot username (without `@`) |
| `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs |
| `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY` | Xendit API secret key |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Run: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` | Password for the admin dashboard |

#### Optional secrets (add the ones you need)

| Secret name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | PayMongo (cards, GCash, GrabPay, Maya) |
| `PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY` | PayMongo public key |
| `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | PayMongo webhook verification |
| `PHOTONPAY_APP_ID` | PhotonPay (Alipay / WeChat) |
| `PHOTONPAY_APP_SECRET` | PhotonPay app secret |
| `PHOTONPAY_SITE_ID` | PhotonPay site ID |
| `TRANSFI_API_KEY` | TransFi (alternative Alipay / WeChat) |
| `TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | TransFi webhook verification |

#### Repository variables (optional overrides)

| Variable name | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | AWS region where the stack was deployed |
| `AWS_CF_STACK_NAME` | `paybot` | CloudFormation stack name from Step 1 |

### Step 4 — Trigger the first deploy

Push a commit to `main` (or run the workflow manually via **Actions → Deploy to AWS → Run workflow**).

The workflow will:
1. Run backend tests
2. Build the Docker image and push it to ECR
3. Render the ECS task definition with your secrets
4. Register the task definition with ECS
5. Create the ECS service on first run (subsequent runs update it)
6. Wait for the service to stabilise

### Step 5 — Configure webhooks

After the first successful deploy, configure each payment gateway webhook to point to your ALB DNS name (from the `LoadBalancerDNS` CloudFormation output):

```
Xendit webhook:   http://<ALB-DNS>/api/v1/xendit/webhook
PayMongo webhook: http://<ALB-DNS>/api/v1/paymongo/webhook
Telegram webhook: http://<ALB-DNS>/api/v1/telegram/webhook
```

To register the Telegram webhook:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=http://<ALB-DNS>/api/v1/telegram/webhook"
```

### Step 6 — (Recommended) Add HTTPS

1. Request a certificate in **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** for your domain
2. Update the CloudFormation stack with the certificate ARN:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name paybot \
  --template-file aws/cloudformation.yml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides \
      EnvironmentName=paybot \
      DBPassword=<same-as-before> \
      CertificateArn=arn:aws:acm:<region>:<account>:certificate/<id>
```

3. Create a CNAME or alias record in Route 53 (or your DNS provider) pointing your domain to the ALB DNS name.
4. Update `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` in GitHub Secrets to use your `https://` domain, then redeploy.

### Monitoring & Logs

View container logs in the AWS Console:

**CloudWatch → Log groups → /ecs/paybot**

Or via CLI:

```bash
aws logs tail /ecs/paybot --follow
```

View ECS service events:

```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster paybot-cluster \
  --services paybot-service \
  --query 'services[0].events[:10]'
```

### Scaling

To run more tasks for higher availability, update the service desired count:

```bash
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster paybot-cluster \
  --service paybot-service \
  --desired-count 2
```

### Teardown

To delete all AWS resources:

```bash
# Delete the ECS service first
aws ecs update-service --cluster paybot-cluster --service paybot-service --desired-count 0
aws ecs delete-service --cluster paybot-cluster --service paybot-service

# Then delete the CloudFormation stack
# (RDS will create a final snapshot before deletion)
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name paybot
```

### Cost estimate

With default settings (`db.t3.micro`, 1 Fargate task at 0.5 vCPU / 1 GB):

| Resource | Approx. monthly cost (us-east-1) |
|---|---|
| ECS Fargate (0.5 vCPU, 1 GB, 24/7) | ~$29 |
| RDS db.t3.micro (gp2 20 GB) | ~$15 |
| Application Load Balancer | ~$16 |
| ECR storage (< 1 GB) | < $0.10 |
| CloudWatch Logs | < $1 |
| **Total** | **~$61 / month** |

> 💡 Use **FARGATE_SPOT** to reduce compute costs by up to 70%.
> In `aws/task-definition.json` keep `"requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"]` but add a
> `"capacityProviderStrategy"` to the `create-service` command in the workflow:
>
> ```bash
> --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE_SPOT,weight=1
> ```
>
> Remove the `--launch-type FARGATE` flag when using capacity provider strategy.

## AWS Deployment (Lightsail)

This guide deploys PayBot on **AWS Lightsail Container Service** — the simplest AWS container option.  Lightsail handles networking, load balancing, and TLS automatically; no VPC, ALB, or ECS configuration is required.  Deployment is fully automated through GitHub Actions.

### Architecture overview

```
Internet → Lightsail Container Service (HTTPS, built-in load balancer)
                └─► paybot container (port 8000)
                      └─► SQLite (default) OR Lightsail Managed PostgreSQL
```

### Pricing

| Resource | Approx. monthly cost |
|---|---|
| Container Service — micro (1 GB RAM, 0.5 vCPU) | ~$10 |
| Container Service — small (2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU) | ~$25 |
| Lightsail Managed Database — micro PostgreSQL (optional) | ~$15 |
| **Total (micro + DB)** | **~$25 / month** |

> 💡 For low-traffic bots, the **nano** tier (~$7/month) with SQLite is sufficient.  Note that SQLite data is lost if the container is replaced; use a managed database for persistence.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with permissions to create Lightsail container services
- AWS CLI installed locally (`aws --version`)
- GitHub repository access to add Secrets and Variables

### Step 1 — Provision the Lightsail Container Service

Run the one-time setup script from the root of the repository:

```bash
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1 \
LIGHTSAIL_SERVICE_NAME=paybot \
LIGHTSAIL_POWER=micro \
bash lightsail/setup.sh
```

> **With a managed PostgreSQL database** (recommended for production):
> ```bash
> AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1 \
> LIGHTSAIL_SERVICE_NAME=paybot \
> LIGHTSAIL_POWER=micro \
> CREATE_DB=true \
> DB_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password> \
> bash lightsail/setup.sh
> ```

After the script completes, note the **Service URL** printed at the end (e.g. `https://paybot.abc123.ap-southeast-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com`).  You will use this as `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL`.

If you created a managed database, wait for it to become **AVAILABLE**, then retrieve its endpoint:

```bash
aws lightsail get-relational-database \
  --relational-database-name paybot-db \
  --query 'relationalDatabase.masterEndpoint.address' \
  --output text
```

Build your `DATABASE_URL` secret:
```
postgresql+asyncpg://paybot:<password>@<endpoint>:5432/paybot?ssl=prefer
```

### Step 2 — Create an IAM user for GitHub Actions

```bash
# Create the user
aws iam create-user --user-name paybot-lightsail-deploy

# Attach a policy granting Lightsail full access
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name paybot-lightsail-deploy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonLightsailFullAccess

# Generate access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name paybot-lightsail-deploy
```

Save the `AccessKeyId` and `SecretAccessKey` for the next step.

> 💡 For a least-privilege policy you can restrict actions to `lightsail:PushContainerImage`, `lightsail:GetContainerImages`, `lightsail:CreateContainerServiceDeployment`, and `lightsail:GetContainerServices`.

### Step 3 — Configure GitHub Secrets and Variables

In your GitHub repository go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

#### Repository variables (`vars.*`)

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `LIGHTSAIL_SERVICE_NAME` | `paybot` (or your service name) |
| `AWS_REGION` | `ap-southeast-1` (or your region) |

#### Repository secrets (`secrets.*`)

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | IAM access key from Step 2 |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM secret key from Step 2 |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` | Bot username (without @) |
| `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs for admins |
| `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY` | Xendit secret key |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Long random string (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` | Dashboard admin password |
| `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` | Lightsail Service URL from Step 1 |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL URL (or omit for SQLite) |

Optional payment gateway secrets (add if needed):

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | PayMongo secret key |
| `PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY` | PayMongo public key |
| `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | PayMongo webhook signing secret |
| `PHOTONPAY_APP_ID` | PhotonPay app ID |
| `PHOTONPAY_APP_SECRET` | PhotonPay app secret |
| `PHOTONPAY_SITE_ID` | PhotonPay site ID |
| `TRANSFI_API_KEY` | TransFi API key |
| `TRANSFI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | TransFi webhook secret |

### Step 4 — Trigger the deployment

Push to `main` or trigger the workflow manually:

```
GitHub → Actions → "Deploy to AWS Lightsail" → Run workflow
```

The workflow will:
1. Run backend tests
2. Build the Docker image (multi-stage: React frontend + Python backend)
3. Push the image to the Lightsail container registry
4. Deploy the container with all environment variables
5. Wait for the service to reach the `RUNNING` state and print the app URL

### Step 5 — Configure webhooks

After deployment, configure payment gateway webhooks to point to your Lightsail URL (same paths as in [Section 5 — Webhook Configuration](#5-webhook-configuration) above, substituting the Lightsail Service URL).

The Telegram webhook is registered automatically on startup.

### Step 6 — Add a custom domain with HTTPS (optional)

Lightsail provides a free `*.cs.amazonlightsail.com` HTTPS URL out of the box.  To use a custom domain:

1. Open the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com) → **Containers** → your service
2. Click **Custom domains** → **Create certificate**
3. Enter your domain (e.g. `paybot.example.com`) and validate via DNS
4. After the certificate is issued, attach it to the container service
5. Add a CNAME record in your DNS provider pointing `paybot.example.com` → your Lightsail service URL
6. Update `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` secret to use the custom domain and redeploy

### Monitoring & Logs

```bash
# Stream container logs
aws lightsail get-container-log \
  --service-name paybot \
  --container-name paybot \
  --region ap-southeast-1
```

Or view logs in the Lightsail console under **Containers → paybot → Logs**.

### Scaling

```bash
# Scale up to 3 nodes
aws lightsail update-container-service \
  --service-name paybot \
  --power micro \
  --scale 3
```

### Teardown

```bash
# Delete the container service
aws lightsail delete-container-service --service-name paybot

# Delete the managed database (if created)
aws lightsail delete-relational-database \
  --relational-database-name paybot-db \
  --no-skip-final-snapshot
```
